# Modulo8CounterFormalVerification
Formal Verification Project Modulo 8 counter modeled in GCLang 

1. Build a model for the counter modulo 8 with binary variables in GCLang.
2. Write an initial set of CTL properties to check correctness of your model. Argue that the set represents the intuitive specification of what we can expect from the counter. For each property, indicate whether it is a safety property or a liveness property and explain why.
3. Show that one of your properties passes vacuously in the system; explain the reason for the vacuous pass and fix the model or the property.
4. Introduce a bug in your model that is not caught by any of the properties. 
5. Explain why this happened and write an additional property that exposes this bug. Demonstrate a counterexample. 
6. Does your initial model satisfy this additional property? If no, explain why not and fix the model. 
7. In your report, include drawings of your models as Kripke structures.
